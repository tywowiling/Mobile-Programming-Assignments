## Description 

Last week project is an application to create an Android App that can find out the list of existing sensors on the device, registers the sensor data listener and handles incoming data from sensors, and also to create Android Apps that can use Google Maps to shows the location of certain objects which are represented by Markers and Shapes (Circle, polylines, and polygons).
